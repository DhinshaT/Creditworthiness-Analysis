# CreditWorthiness-Analysis
Creditworthiness is a lender's willingness to trust you to pay your debts. Lenders evaluate creditworthiness in a variety of ways, typically by reviewing your past handling of credit and debt, and, in many cases, by assessing your ability to afford the payments required to repay the debt.
This project aims to identify  the factors that manage a person’s credit worthiness. Whether the person is under the high risk category or not.
# Problem Statement
A person’s creditworthiness is often associated (conversely) with the likelihood they may default on loans. 
Based on the applicant details and loan history we are finding whether they were considered high risk.
0 = Low credit risk i.e high chance of paying back the loan amount
1 = High credit risk i.e low chance of paying back the loan amount
# Methodology
1. Combined the Dataset
2. Data preprocessing ( Handled the missing values )
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Model Built
